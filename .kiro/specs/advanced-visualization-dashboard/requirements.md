# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing stock prediction system by implementing a comprehensive visualization and reporting dashboard. The system currently has basic visualization capabilities, but users need advanced interactive charts, performance dashboards, and comprehensive reporting to better understand model behavior, prediction accuracy, and ensemble performance over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want interactive charts showing historical vs predicted prices with confidence intervals, so that I can visually assess model accuracy and prediction uncertainty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run a prediction THEN the system SHALL generate an interactive price chart with actual vs predicted values
2. WHEN viewing the price chart THEN the system SHALL display confidence intervals as shaded bands around predictions
3. WHEN I hover over data points THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including date, actual price, predicted price, and confidence bounds
4. WHEN I zoom or pan the chart THEN the system SHALL maintain interactivity and data precision
5. IF multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL allow toggling individual model predictions on/off

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want a comprehensive performance dashboard comparing all models, so that I can understand which models perform best under different market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a performance dashboard THEN the system SHALL display metrics for all trained models in a comparison table
2. WHEN viewing model performance THEN the system SHALL show RMSE, MAE, directional accuracy, and RÂ² score for each model
3. WHEN analyzing ensemble performance THEN the system SHALL display current model weights and their evolution over time
4. WHEN examining model behavior THEN the system SHALL show performance across different time periods and market conditions
5. IF backtesting data is available THEN the system SHALL display rolling performance metrics over time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want detailed model analysis charts including feature importance and prediction distributions, so that I can understand what drives model predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Random Forest model THEN the system SHALL display feature importance rankings with interactive bars
2. WHEN examining prediction quality THEN the system SHALL show residual plots and prediction error distributions
3. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL display correlation matrices between model predictions
4. WHEN evaluating ensemble THEN the system SHALL show weight allocation pie charts and weight evolution over time
5. IF technical indicators are used THEN the system SHALL display their values alongside price predictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want comprehensive HTML reports that can be shared and archived, so that I can document prediction results and model performance for compliance and decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive HTML document with all charts and metrics
2. WHEN viewing the report THEN it SHALL include executive summary, model performance, predictions, and technical details
3. WHEN sharing reports THEN they SHALL be self-contained with embedded charts and styling
4. WHEN archiving results THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, configuration, and data source information
5. IF multiple stocks are analyzed THEN the system SHALL support batch report generation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable visualization settings and export options, so that I can customize the dashboard appearance and output formats for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring visualizations THEN the system SHALL allow customization of colors, themes, and chart types
2. WHEN exporting charts THEN the system SHALL support PNG, SVG, and PDF formats
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow template customization and branding
4. WHEN displaying dashboards THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes
5. IF performance is a concern THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable expensive visualizations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular visualization system that can be easily extended, so that I can add new chart types and analysis tools without modifying core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new visualizations THEN the system SHALL use a plugin-based architecture
2. WHEN creating charts THEN the system SHALL provide base classes and common utilities
3. WHEN integrating with the main system THEN visualizations SHALL access data through well-defined interfaces
4. WHEN testing visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide mock data and testing utilities
5. IF new chart libraries are needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple visualization backends
