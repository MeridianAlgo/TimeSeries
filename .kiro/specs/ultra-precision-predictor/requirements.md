# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an ultra-precision machine learning system specifically designed to achieve prediction errors under 0.5% for stock price forecasting. The system employs cutting-edge techniques including extreme feature engineering, advanced ensemble methods, meta-learning, adaptive outlier removal, and multi-stage prediction refinement. This represents a significant advancement beyond traditional prediction systems, targeting institutional-grade accuracy for high-frequency trading and quantitative finance applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want an extreme feature engineering pipeline that creates hundreds of ultra-precise features, so that I can capture micro-patterns and subtle market dynamics that traditional systems miss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN creating temporal features THEN the system SHALL implement multi-scale momentum analysis with lookback periods from 1 to 89 bars using Fibonacci sequences
3. WHEN generating volatility features THEN the system SHALL calculate volatility-of-volatility, regime detection, and volatility clustering indicators across multiple timeframes
4. WHEN building market microstructure features THEN the system SHALL create bid-ask spread proxies, price impact measures, and market efficiency indicators
5. WHEN feature engineering is complete THEN the system SHALL achieve feature density of at least 500 features per prediction sample

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want an adaptive outlier removal system that eliminates data points causing prediction errors, so that I can train models on only the most predictable market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting outliers THEN the system SHALL apply multi-stage outlier detection using Z-scores, modified Z-scores, IQR methods, and local outlier factors
2. WHEN removing outliers THEN the system SHALL use extremely strict thresholds (Z-score < 1.0) to eliminate any potentially problematic data points
3. WHEN outlier removal is applied THEN the system SHALL remove at least 20% of training data to focus on highly predictable patterns
4. WHEN outliers are identified THEN the system SHALL log removal statistics and maintain data quality metrics
5. WHEN clean data is prepared THEN the system SHALL ensure remaining data has minimal variance and maximum predictability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial engineer, I want a multi-level ensemble system with meta-learning capabilities, so that I can achieve prediction accuracy beyond what single models can provide.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the base ensemble THEN the system SHALL train at least 12 different models including Random Forest variants, Extra Trees, and Gradient Boosting with extreme hyperparameter tuning
2. WHEN implementing meta-learning THEN the system SHALL train second-level models that learn from base model predictions to further refine accuracy
3. WHEN calculating ensemble weights THEN the system SHALL use exponential weighting that heavily penalizes models with errors above 0.5%
4. WHEN combining predictions THEN the system SHALL implement confidence-weighted averaging with dynamic weight adjustment based on recent performance
5. WHEN ensemble is complete THEN the system SHALL achieve cross-validation errors below 1.0% on individual models

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a high-frequency trader, I want multi-stage prediction refinement with smoothing and outlier correction, so that I can eliminate prediction spikes and achieve consistent sub-0.5% accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating initial predictions THEN the system SHALL apply three-stage smoothing using rolling windows and median filtering
2. WHEN detecting prediction outliers THEN the system SHALL identify and correct predictions that deviate significantly from local patterns
3. WHEN applying final smoothing THEN the system SHALL use adaptive smoothing that preserves genuine price movements while eliminating noise
4. WHEN refinement is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure no single prediction exceeds 2% error from the smoothed ensemble
5. WHEN predictions are finalized THEN the system SHALL validate that at least 70% of predictions have errors below 0.5%

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want ultra-precise performance measurement and validation, so that I can verify the system consistently achieves sub-0.5% error rates across different market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL calculate percentage errors for each prediction with precision to 0.001%
2. WHEN validating accuracy THEN the system SHALL report the percentage of predictions achieving sub-0.5% error rates
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide accuracy breakdowns at 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0% thresholds
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic model retraining if sub-0.5% rate falls below 50%
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive accuracy reports with statistical significance testing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want advanced cross-validation with time series awareness, so that I can ensure the ultra-precision system performs consistently across different time periods and market regimes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing cross-validation THEN the system SHALL use TimeSeriesSplit with at least 10 folds to ensure temporal integrity
2. WHEN validating across time periods THEN the system SHALL test performance on bull markets, bear markets, and sideways markets separately
3. WHEN measuring consistency THEN the system SHALL ensure standard deviation of errors across folds is below 0.2%
4. WHEN detecting regime changes THEN the system SHALL adapt model weights dynamically based on current market conditions
5. WHEN cross-validation is complete THEN the system SHALL achieve mean cross-validation error below 0.8% across all folds

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for prediction quality, so that I can ensure the system maintains ultra-precision standards in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring predictions THEN the system SHALL track real-time error rates and alert when sub-0.5% rate drops below 60%
2. WHEN detecting performance degradation THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger model retraining workflows
3. WHEN errors exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics including feature importance changes and model drift analysis
4. WHEN system health is assessed THEN the system SHALL maintain logs of all predictions, errors, and model performance metrics
5. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for maintaining ultra-precision performance
