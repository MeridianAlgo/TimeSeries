# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a machine learning ensemble system for predicting future stock prices using historical time series data. The system combines multiple models (ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest) to create robust predictions of stock price movements, specifically focusing on OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candle data. The ensemble approach aims to leverage the strengths of different modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to fetch and preprocess historical stock data, so that I can train machine learning models on clean, feature-rich time series data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is requested to fetch stock data THEN it SHALL retrieve OHLC data for a specified stock symbol from Yahoo Finance covering the last 5 years up to August 12, 2025
2. WHEN missing values are detected in the dataset THEN the system SHALL handle them using appropriate imputation methods
3. WHEN raw data is processed THEN the system SHALL normalize price data and create engineered features including moving averages, volatility measures, and lagged values
4. WHEN data preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL split the data into training, validation, and test sets with appropriate time-based splitting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to train individual prediction models, so that I can evaluate different approaches for stock price forecasting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training individual models THEN the system SHALL implement an ARIMA model for baseline linear forecasting
2. WHEN training individual models THEN the system SHALL implement an LSTM neural network for capturing non-linear temporal patterns
3. WHEN training individual models THEN the system SHALL implement a Random Forest model for feature-based predictions
4. WHEN each model is trained THEN it SHALL predict the next candle's close price using historical OHLC data
5. WHEN model training is complete THEN the system SHALL save trained model artifacts for later use

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to evaluate model performance using multiple metrics, so that I can understand each model's strengths and weaknesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each model
2. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model
3. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL calculate directional accuracy (percentage of correct up/down predictions)
4. WHEN performance metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL display results in a comparative format
5. WHEN models underperform THEN the system SHALL support hyperparameter tuning via grid search to minimize error rates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want an ensemble model that combines individual predictions, so that I can get more robust and reliable forecasts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the ensemble THEN the system SHALL combine predictions using weighted averaging based on historical error rates
2. WHEN calculating ensemble weights THEN the system SHALL assign higher weights to models with better historical performance
3. WHEN ensemble predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals for the predictions
4. WHEN new data becomes available THEN the system SHALL support dynamic weight adjustment based on recent model performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to backtest the ensemble on unseen data, so that I can evaluate real-world performance before using it for actual trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting is performed THEN the system SHALL use time-series cross-validation on unseen historical data
2. WHEN backtesting THEN the system SHALL simulate real-world conditions by using only past data for predictions
3. WHEN backtest results are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate performance metrics over multiple time periods
4. WHEN backtesting reveals performance issues THEN the system SHALL adjust ensemble weights dynamically based on recent errors
5. WHEN backtest is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive performance report

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an investment analyst, I want to generate future predictions with visualizations, so that I can make informed decisions about stock movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL forecast stock prices for the next 7 days
2. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL include confidence intervals for each prediction
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL create visualizations showing historical data, predictions, and confidence bands
4. WHEN visualizations are created THEN they SHALL include actual vs predicted comparisons for validation periods
5. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL export results in both tabular and graphical formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the prediction system to be configurable and maintainable, so that it can be adapted for different stocks and market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support different stock symbols and date ranges
2. WHEN system parameters need adjustment THEN the system SHALL provide configuration files for model hyperparameters
3. WHEN models need retraining THEN the system SHALL support automated retraining workflows
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and error handling
5. WHEN system performance degrades THEN it SHALL alert users and suggest remediation actions
