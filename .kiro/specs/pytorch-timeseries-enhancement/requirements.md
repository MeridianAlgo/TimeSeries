#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting is initiated THEN the system SHALL implement walk-forward analysis with configurable training/testing windows
2. WHEN testing across time periods THEN the system SHALL maintain separate performance metrics for bull, bear, and sideways markets
3. WHEN market regime changes THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to different volatility environments
4. IF prediction accuracy drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger model retraining automatically
5. WHEN backtesting is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance reports with statistical significance tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want prediction confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification, so that I can assess the reliability of predictions and make informed risk decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals for each prediction
2. WHEN uncertainty is high THEN the system SHALL flag predictions with low confidence scores
3. WHEN calculating confidence THEN the system SHALL use Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble variance methods
4. IF prediction uncertainty exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL recommend position size adjustments
5. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL include uncertainty metrics alongside point predictions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want multi-asset prediction capabilities, so that I can generate predictions for entire portfolios and identify cross-asset relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple assets THEN the system SHALL handle batch prediction for up to 50 symbols simultaneously
2. WHEN analyzing cross-correlations THEN the system SHALL identify and utilize inter-asset relationships
3. WHEN making portfolio predictions THEN the system SHALL consider sector and market-wide factors
4. IF correlation patterns change THEN the system SHALL adapt cross-asset feature weights dynamically
5. WHEN portfolio analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide asset ranking based on prediction confidence and expected returns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can ensure the prediction system operates reliably and maintains accuracy standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL monitor prediction accuracy in real-time
2. WHEN accuracy degrades THEN the system SHALL send alerts and log performance issues
3. WHEN data quality issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and flag anomalous input data
4. IF system performance drops THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to backup models
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL maintain performance dashboards with key metrics visualization

### Requirement 7
